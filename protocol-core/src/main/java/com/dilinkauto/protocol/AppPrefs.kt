 * Cross-module SharedPreferences contract.

 * Holds the shared prefs file name and the keys that are read/written from
 * more than one file. A typo in a key string silently breaks the link
 * between writer and reader (e.g. IME restore reading a key that was never
 * written); collecting them here makes the contract explicit.
 *
 * Module-local keys that never cross a file boundary stay where they are.
