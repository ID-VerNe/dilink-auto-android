/**
 * Adaptive bitrate policy for the encode hot path.
 *
 * Extracted from [GlPipeline] so the policy can be unit-tested without EGL,
 * MediaCodec or a socket. The pipeline thread measures how long each frame's
 * socket write took and feeds the result in; this class decides whether the
 * encoder bitrate should move and asks for a sync frame when it drops.
 *
 * Two independent reactions to the same signal, by design:
 *  - **Back-pressure (fast):** a write slower than [slowWriteMillis] means the
 *    car is not draining. Drop to 75% (never below [MIN_BITRATE]) and request a
 *    sync frame so the new rate takes effect immediately.
 *  - **Recovery (slow):** after [cleanIntervalMillis] with no slow write, creep
 *    the rate back up by [RECOVERY_STEP] per interval, never above the ceiling
 *    the caller configured.
 *
 * Pure and allocation-free on the hot path: [onFrameWritten] returns `true`
 * when it wants the caller to apply [currentBitrate].
